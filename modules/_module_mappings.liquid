=== Mapping specification

In the following, "Application element" designates any entity data type defined
in <<arm>>, any of its explicit attributes and any subtype constraint. "MIM
element" designates any entity data type defined in <<mim_express>> or imported
with a USE FROM statement, from another EXPRESS schema, any of its attributes
and any subtype constraint defined in <<mim_express>> or imported with a USE
FROM statement.

This clause contains the mapping specification that defines how each application
element of this part of ISO 10303 (see <<arm>>) maps to one or more MIM elements
(see <<mim_express>>).

The mapping for each application element is specified in a separate subclause
below. The mapping specification of an attribute of an ARM entity is a subclause
of the clause that contains the mapping specification of this entity. Each
mapping specification subclause contains up to five elements.

*Title:* The clause title contains:

* the name of the considered ARM entity or subtype constraint, or

* the name of the considered ARM entity attribute when this attribute refers to
a type that is not an entity data type or a SELECT type that contains or may
contain entity data types, or

* a composite expression, `<attribute name>` to `<referred type>`, when this
attribute refers to a type that is not an entity data type or a SELECT type that
contains or may contain entity data types.

*MIM element:* This section contains, depending on the considered application
element:

* the name of one or more MIM entity data types;

* the name of a MIM entity attribute, presented with the syntax
`<entity name>.<attribute name>`, when the considered ARM attribute refers to a
type that is not an entity data type or a SELECT type that contains or may
contain entity data types;

* the term PATH, when the considered ARM entity attribute refers to an entity
data type or to a SELECT type that contains or may contain entity data types;

* the term IDENTICAL MAPPING, when both application objects involved in an
application assertion map to the same instance of a MIM entity data type;

* the term NO MAPPING EXTENSION PROVIDED, when the extension to an extensible
SELECT TYPE has no impact;

* the syntax `/SUPERTYPE(<supertype name>)/`, when the considered ARM entity is
mapped as its supertype;

* one or more constructs `/SUBTYPE(<subtype name>)/`, when the mapping of the
considered ARM entity is the union of the mapping of its subtypes.

When the mapping of an application element involves more than one MIM element,
each of these MIM elements is presented on a separate line in the mapping
specification, enclosed between parentheses or brackets.

*Source:* This section contains:

* the ISO standard number and part number in which the MIM element is defined,
for those MIM elements that are defined in a common resource document;

* the ISO standard number and part number of this part of ISO 10303, for those
MIM elements that are defined in the MIM schema of this part.

This section is omitted when the keywords PATH or IDENTICAL MAPPING or NO
MAPPING EXTENSION PROVIDED are used in the MIM element section.

*Rules:* This section contains the name of one or more global rules that apply
to the population of the MIM entity data types listed in the MIM element section
or in the reference path. When no rule applies, this section is omitted.

A reference to a global rule may be followed by a reference to the subclause in
which the rule is defined.

*Constraint:* This section contains the name of one or more subtype constraints
that apply to the population of the MIM entity data types listed in the MIM
element section or in the reference path. When no subtype constraint applies,
this section is omitted.

A reference to a subtype constraint may be followed by a reference to the
subclause in which the subtype constraint is defined.

*Reference path:* This section contains:

* the reference path to its supertypes in the common resources, for each MIM
element created within this part of ISO 10303;

* the specification of the relationships between MIM elements, when the mapping
of an application element requires to relate instances of several MIM entity
data types. In such a case, each line in the reference path documents the role
of a MIM element relative to the referring MIM element or to the next referred
MIM element.

For the expression of reference paths and of the constraints between MIM
elements, the following notational conventions apply:

`[]`::
enclosed section constrains multiple MIM elements or sections of the reference
path are required to satisfy an information requirement;

`()`::
enclosed section constrains multiple MIM elements or sections of the reference
path are identified as alternatives within the mapping to satisfy an information
requirement;

`{}`::
enclosed section constrains the reference path to satisfy an information
requirement;

`<>`::
enclosed section constrains at one or more required reference path;

`||`::
enclosed section constrains the supertype entity;

`\->`::
the attribute, whose name precedes the `\->` symbol, references the entity or
select type whose name follows the `\->` symbol;

`<&#x200c;-`::
the entity or select type, whose name precedes the `<&#x200c;-` symbol, is referenced by
the entity attribute whose name follows the `<&#x200c;-` symbol;

`[i]`::
the attribute, whose name precedes the `[i]` symbol, is an aggregate; any element
of that aggregate is referred to;

`[n]`::
the attribute, whose name precedes the `[n]` symbol, is an ordered aggregate;
member n of that aggregate is referred to;

`\=>`::
the entity, whose name precedes the `\=>` symbol, is a supertype of the entity
whose name follows the `\=>` symbol;

`<&#x200c;=`::
the entity, whose name precedes the `<&#x200c;=` symbol, is a subtype of the entity whose
name follows the `<&#x200c;=` symbol;

`=`::
the string, select, or enumeration type is constrained to a choice or value;

`\`::
the reference path expression continues on the next line;

`*`::
one or more instances of the relationship entity data type may be assembled
in a relationship tree structure. The path between the relationship entity and
the related entities, is enclosed with braces;

`--`::
the text following is a comment or introduces a clause reference;

`*>`::
the select or enumeration type, whose name precedes the `\*>` symbol, is
extended into the select or enumeration type whose name follows the `*>` symbol;

`<*`::
the select or enumeration type, whose name precedes the `<*` symbol, is an
extension of the select or enumeration type whose name follows the `<*` symbol;

`!{}`::
section enclosed by `{}` indicates a negative constraint placed on the mapping.

The definition and use of mapping templates are not supported in the present
version of the application modules. However, use of predefined templates
/MAPPING_OF/, /SUBTYPE/, and /SUPERTYPE/ is supported.
