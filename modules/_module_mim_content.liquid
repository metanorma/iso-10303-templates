=== MIM EXPRESS short listing

This clause specifies the EXPRESS schema derived from the mapping table. It uses
elements from the common resources or from other application modules and defines
the EXPRESS constructs that are specific to this part of ISO 10303.

This clause constitutes the Module Interpreted Module (MIM) of the application
module.

This clause also specifies the modifications that apply to the constructs
imported from the common resources.

The following restrictions apply to the use, in this schema, of constructs
defined in common resources or in application modules:

* use of a supertype entity does not make applicable any of its specializations,
unless the specialization is also imported in the MIM schema;

* use of a SELECT type does not make applicable any of its listed types unless
the listed type is also imported in the MIM schema.

Short names of entities defined in this schema are described in <<AnnexA>>.
Unambiguous identification of this schema is defined in <<AnnexB>>.
