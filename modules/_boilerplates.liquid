{% case fetch %}
{% when "ARM type" %}
This subclause specifies the ARM types for this application module.
The ARM types and definitions are specified below.

{% when "ARM entity" %}
This subclause specifies the ARM entities for this module. Each ARM application
entity is an atomic element that embodies a unique application concept and contains
attributes specifying the data elements of the entity. The ARM entities and definitions
are specified below.

{% when "ARM subtype constraint" %}
This subclause specifies the ARM subtype constraints for this module.
Each subtype constraint places constraints on the possible super-type / subtype instantiations.
The ARM subtype constraints and definitions are specified below.

{% when "ARM function" %}
This subclause specifies the ARM function for this module. The ARM function and definition
is specified below.

{% when "short_listing_intro" %}
This clause specifies the EXPRESS schema derived from the mapping table. It uses
elements from the common resources or from other application modules and defines
the EXPRESS constructs that are specific to this part of ISO 10303.

This clause constitutes the Module Interpreted Module (MIM) of the application
module.

This clause also specifies the modifications that apply to the constructs
imported from the common resources.

The following restrictions apply to the use, in this schema, of constructs
defined in common resources or in application modules:

* use of a supertype entity does not make applicable any of its specializations,
unless the specialization is also imported in the MIM schema;

* use of a SELECT type does not make applicable any of its listed types unless
the listed type is also imported in the MIM schema.

Short names of entities defined in this schema are described in <<AnnexA>>.
Unambiguous identification of this schema is defined in <<AnnexB>>.

{% when "MIM type" %}
This subclause specifies the MIM types for this application module. The MIM types and definitions are specified below.

{% when "MIM entity" %}
This subclause specifies the MIM entities for this module.
The MIM entities and definitions are specified below.

{% when "MIM function" %}
This subclause specifies the MIM functions for this module. The MIM functions and definitions are
specified below.

{% when "MIM rule" %}
This subclause specifies the MIM rules for this module. The MIM rules and definitions are specified below.
