The ISO 10303 series of International Standards describe the
computer-interpretable representation of product information for the exchange of
product data.
The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing products
throughout their life cycle.
This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a
basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as a basis for
archiving.
