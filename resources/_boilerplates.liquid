This clause defines the information requirements to which implementations shall conform using the EXPRESS language as defined in ISO 10303-11. The following EXPRESS declaration begins the *{{ id }}* and identifies the necessary external references.

Each implementation of an AP that uses this schema and that encodes entity names shall use the encoding specified in <<annex_entity_names>>. Each reference to this schema in an open system shall use the identifier encoding specified in <<annex_object_registration>>. This schema is illustrated in <<annex_expg>> using the EXPRESS-G notation. {% unless EXCEPTIONS contains id -%} Publicly available computer interpretable listings that are associated with this document are identified in <<annex_listings>>. {%- endunless %}

The following EXPRESS declaration begins the *{{ id }}* and identifies the necessary external references.

The *{{ id }}* type is an extensible list of alternate data types. It provides a mechanism to refer to instances of the data types included in the *{{ id }}* type or in its extensions.

NOTE: The list of entity data types will be extended in application resources that use the constructs of this resource.

The *{{ id }}* type is a list of alternate data types. It provides a mechanism to refer to an instance of one of these data types.
