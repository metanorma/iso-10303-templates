Implementations of this document shall make use of the capability to classify an
entity type using **Classification_assignment** (see ISO 10303-1114), **Class**
(see ISO 10303-1070) and **External_class** (see ISO 10303-1275).

This annex contains a subclause for each entity type defined in or used by this
document for which that capability shall be applied. The specified Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) is used to identify each class.

NOTE: A URI can be a HTTP URI. However, the use of a HTTP URI does not
necessarily mean that a HTTP GET obtains a representation of the specified
resource. Even if a representation is obtained, that representation is not
necessarily part of the standard.

For the purpose of diagramming possible classifications of EXPRESS entity types,
UML 1.4 or later class diagrams with stereotypes are used. The W3C OWL Web
Ontology Language is used to represent the classes that may be applied to an
EXPRESS entity type both in the diagrams and as example OWL files.

NOTE: The standards related to the specification of reference data are:
+
--
* the http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/uml.htm[UML 2 specification]
is available from the OMG Web site;

* the http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/05-04-01[ISO UML 1.4.2 specification]
published as ISO/IEC 19501:2005(E) is available from the OMG Web site
and from the http://www.iso.org[ISO Web site];

* the http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/[OWL Web Ontology Language Reference] is
available from the W3C Web site.

The diagram notation is interpreted as follows:

* the `<<expressEntityType>>` stereotype applied to a UML Class denotes an
EXPRESS entity type;

* the `<<owlClass>>` stereotype applied to a UML Class denotes the related
class(es);

* if all OWL classes on a diagram have the same namespace it may be omitted,
otherwise the XML namespace of the OWL ontology containing each class is
represented as the UML Package name which appears under the class name enclosed
in parentheses;

* the `<<classificationAssignment>>` stereotype applied to a UML Generalization
denotes the fact that the EXPRESS entity type can be classified using the more
specific class;

* the `<<disjointWith>>` stereotype applied to a UML constraint note is included
where appropriate to specify the set of OWL classes are mutually exclusive

* the OWL `subClassOf` relationship between OWL classes is denoted using
unstereotyped generalizations between the stereotyped UML classes;

* no other UML, EXPRESS or OWL concepts appear in these diagrams.
